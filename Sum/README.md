#### Create three threads, t1, t2 and t3. t1 should print the integers from 1 to 10, compute the sum of the integers and print out the sum. t2 should print the integers from 11^2 to 20^2, compute the sum and then print out the sum. t3 should print the integers from 21^3 to 30^3, compute the sum and then print out the sum. When you print out the values, you should also print the thread id using “Thread.currentThread().getId()”. After all the threads finish the work, print “Finally”.
